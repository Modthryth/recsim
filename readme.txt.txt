
-------------------Recombination simulation code------------------------

This code is used for simulations of recombination. It is based on nucleic acid recombination
but since specific sequences are not defined, it could be used for any type of polymer recombination
where the polymers consist of one or more building blocks.

Recsim.cpp is the main C++ file

altRandom.h is taken from Arvid Gestmann. I use the PCG random number generator for speed.

The code itself is annotated to assist its comprehension.
